Profitability, Popularity & Revenue
Guiding Decisions with Data

For this analysis we looked at movies that were rated as of 3/25/19 the 250 best and 100 worst (by user reviews) to determine if movie popularity should be considered among the top concerns when assesing what new movies to make to ensure profitability.

The primary source for information was imdb.com.
